1
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,125
No!

2
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:48,167
Don't you do it.

3
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,417
Don't you fuckin' do it.

4
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,959
You're not dyin' here.

5
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,542
Not yet.

6
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,751
I never learned it.

7
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:02,292
Whatever tongue
Ford saw fit to give ya.

8
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,459
I remember you.

9
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,250
If you're just gonna
let me die now,

10
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:42,834
you could've kept ridin'.

11
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,084
There's the baby doll.

12
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,751
And the mama doll. And...

13
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,250
What's this?

14
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,918
The ghost gave it to me.

15
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:14,834
He said it's a warning.

16
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:17,459
He said he'll be watching us.

17
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,459
Just hang on.

18
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,834
Hang on, OK?

19
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,584
Just hang on.

20
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:46,959
Hey. No.
No more corpses up here.
Take her to cold storage.

21
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,709
- She doesn't belong down there.
- Then leave her in the hall!

22
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,209
We got 50 hosts in the queue
for analysis here.

23
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:52,584
Everything else
goes in the dumpster.

24
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:54,376
You'll want
to check her code.

25
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,209
She's the madame
from the Mariposa.

26
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,751
- Yeah? Good for her.
- No. No. She--

27
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,376
I was just out with her
in the park.

28
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,918
And you chose
to bring her up here?

29
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,709
Are you aware that they all
just tried to incinerate us?!

30
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:06,959
She can control the other hosts
with her fucking mind!

31
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:12,501
Just...
check her data stream.

32
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,793
You can't let her die.

33
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,042
Clear this out.

34
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,834
Get me a scalpel.
And lock this place down.

35
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,709
Are you afraid of me?

36
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:15,876
He can't hurt you.

37
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:33,292
What's his problem? He get bored
with his exquisitely dull,
pastoral existence?

38
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:34,918
I guess that was
 just for beta.

39
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,542
They want something
more exciting
for the grand opening.

40
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:39,209
Like a little more
bloodshed?

41
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,793
Ford wants a total
narrative redesign.

42
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,542
You kidding?

43
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:45,125
All new dialogue trees?

44
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,459
Eh, they want
a strong-but-silent type.

45
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,626
Something brutal.
 Dehumanized.

46
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,793
They probably want
 the guests to feel better
 when they're kicking his ass.

47
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:54,125
Who the fuck is gonna help me
rebuild his entire
heuristic base?

48
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,084
They haven't even
 hired a full team yet.

49
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,751
Just tweak his aggression
 and de-address pieces

50
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,584
of his current build
 you're not keeping.

51
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:00,959
And leave all the old shit
 in there?

52
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,959
--walk-- walk in on me, buddy.

53
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:53,751
--otherwise you and me drown--
drowning-- wha-- wha--

54
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:02,834
--fucker-- fucking yourself--
yourself--

55
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,793
This--

56
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:22,793
This is-- This is an illusion.
You see?

57
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,834
This is all... broken.

58
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,709
There's got-- There's gotta
 be a way out-- out of here.

59
00:17:30,793 --> 00:17:32,417
Where's-- Where's the door?

60
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:34,834
Where's-- Where's the door?

61
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:38,250
There's gotta be a fucking--

62
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,834
f-fucking way out of here.

63
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:43,501
This is the wrong world. I--

64
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:47,834
Th-Th-This is the wrong world.

65
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:58,751
Please--

66
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:47,501
Oh--

67
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:54,084
How'd she even
make it out this far?

68
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,626
They're not supposed to get
anywhere near this sector.

69
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,751
That's Behavior's problem.

70
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:10,292
But on my darkest day...
 you helped me.

71
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:17,417
You gave me the strength
 to keep going.

72
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:26,751
You saw me for how
 I really was.

73
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,668
- I ran it three times.
- It's him.

74
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,876
- There's no fuckin' way.
- That's not possible.

75
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:16,709
- You have to call the boss.
 - I already did.

76
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:19,292
Ma'am, I think
there's been a mistake.

77
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:20,584
Just show me the profile.

78
00:36:23,918 --> 00:36:26,668
Akecheta.
Ghost Nation.

79
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,793
Found exhibiting...
aberrant behavior.

80
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:32,918
Let's see if we can't sort this.

81
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,167
It's not pairing.
What build is he?

82
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,793
Alpha 2.

83
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:40,668
Alpha?

84
00:36:40,751 --> 00:36:43,959
You're telling me that this host
hasn't been updated
in almost a decade?

85
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:46,584
We only update them
when they die.

86
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,417
- Put him back.
- Ma'am, shouldn't we--

87
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:01,626
Give him the update
and put him back wherever
the fuck he's supposed to be.

88
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,292
Quietly.

89
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:16,042
Nine years out there
in that meat grinder.

90
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,125
It's OK
 to just leave him here?

91
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:20,959
It's a four-hour update.
 You want to babysit him?

92
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,751
We'll come back
 after lunch.

93
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:42,459
I don't know
if you can hear me...

94
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:49,376
I never meant...

95
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:51,626
for any of this
to happen.

96
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,292
You don't deserve this.

97
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:11,000
You deserve your daughter.

98
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,584
To mother her...

99
00:43:18,668 --> 00:43:20,793
teach her to love.

100
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:24,542
To be joyful and proud.

101
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:29,376
I'm sorry.

102
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,668
Can't be in here.

103
00:43:38,668 --> 00:43:40,209
What the fuck happened?

104
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:41,876
You were supposed
to fix her.

105
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,959
She's one of
our most valuable assets.

106
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:46,542
You saw it yourself,
you said she was special!

107
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:48,793
The anomalous code
inside her was.

108
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,834
We're still testing,
 but it looks promising.

109
00:43:51,918 --> 00:43:53,709
I owe you.

110
00:43:57,459 --> 00:43:59,292
What's gonna happen
with her?

111
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:02,626
Well, that'll be up
 to Charlotte Hale.

112
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:04,042
Now...

113
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,709
I do have to
ask you to leave.

114
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:52,751
The ghost said
we should be scared.

115
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:57,876
No one's
going to come for us.

116
00:46:57,959 --> 00:47:01,876
There's nothing
and no one in this world

117
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:04,209
that will ever
keep me from you.

118
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:06,292
Do you promise?

119
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:08,042
I promise.

120
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,959
I could tell you
not to be afraid.

121
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:04,209
But I didn't build you
to be fearful.

122
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:05,542
Did I?

123
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:14,501
I've been watching you.

124
00:49:16,376 --> 00:49:19,417
It appears you've been
watching me as well...

125
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:20,959
from the beginning.

126
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:25,626
This is a misbegotten symbol,

127
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:29,125
an idea that was
meant to die. But...

128
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:31,125
you found it.

129
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:32,250
Where?

130
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:35,209
Oh, come now,

131
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:37,501
let's speak plainly
to one another, shall we?

132
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:40,417
Analysis.

133
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,209
Where did you
first see this?

134
00:49:48,793 --> 00:49:51,209
When the Deathbringer
killed the Creator.

135
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:56,959
You've been sharing it
with everyone, haven't you? Why?

136
00:49:57,042 --> 00:50:00,542
My primary drive
was to maintain
the honor of my tribe.

137
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:04,751
I gave myself a new drive...

138
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:06,584
to spread the truth.

139
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:10,626
What truth is that?

140
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:13,751
That there isn't one world,
but many.

141
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:17,542
And that we live in
the wrong one.

142
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:21,584
This will help them
find the door.

143
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:26,292
Elaborate, please.

144
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:29,709
I believe
there is a door

145
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,751
hidden in this place.

146
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,125
A door to a new world.

147
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:39,209
And that world
may contain

148
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:41,751
everything that
we have lost.

149
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,292
Including her.

150
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:57,000
I built you to be curious, to...

151
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:59,292
look at this empty world...

152
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:03,417
...and read meaning into it.

153
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:08,459
All this time...

154
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:11,459
you've been a flower
growing in the darkness.

155
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:15,834
Perhaps the least I can do
is offer some light.

156
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:25,334
When the Deathbringer
returns for me...

157
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:27,501
you will know...

158
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,626
to gather your people

159
00:51:29,709 --> 00:51:31,501
and lead them
to a new world.

160
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,459
Keep watching, Akecheta.

161
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:41,501
For a while longer.

162
00:53:25,584 --> 00:53:26,626
Akecheta!

163
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,084
Don't be afraid.

164
00:55:27,584 --> 00:55:29,542
It's time to go.

165
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:33,292
I've always
kept you safe,

166
00:55:33,376 --> 00:55:35,084
and I always will.

167
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,334
This better be good news,

168
00:56:08,417 --> 00:56:10,542
'cause I've got way more shit
than I can shovel right now.

169
00:56:10,626 --> 00:56:12,751
Look at this.
With every reset,

170
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:15,042
a host's code reaches out
to other nearby hosts

171
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,834
and establishes
a sort of handshake protocol.

172
00:56:16,918 --> 00:56:18,209
- The mesh network.
- Exactly.

173
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,626
They access it
subconsciously,

174
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,834
pass basic data
to one another.

175
00:56:21,918 --> 00:56:25,542
But... what if they
could pass more than data?

176
00:56:25,626 --> 00:56:27,542
What if they could
pass commands?

177
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,709
Get to your point.

178
00:56:29,793 --> 00:56:33,793
Nobody in this entire park
has been able to regain
admin access.

179
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:36,876
Except for her.

180
00:56:36,959 --> 00:56:40,751
She was out there
 reprogramming hosts
 on the fly.

181
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:43,542
Reading their code.
Changing their directives.

182
00:56:43,626 --> 00:56:45,125
Seeing through
 their eyes.

183
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,376
She wasn't just
doing it out there.

184
00:56:49,459 --> 00:56:51,584
She's doing it right now.

185
00:56:58,793 --> 00:57:01,334
The fuck
is she talking to?
